3. Introduction
Text | Paragraph | Welcome to Williams Kingdom English Education Centre! We are an Education organisation with the purpose of improving your child’s English proficiency. So why choose us? Well, that’s simple! We believe students learn more efficiently when they feel motivated and enjoy what they are learning. That’s why we ensure that our teaching approach is exciting and inspiring. Our team is composed of highly qualified Native English teachers, who have been carefully chosen for their passion, dedication and teaching abilities. We keep our class sizes small (1-6 students) to ensure that our teaching quality remains high. Our students feel comfortable enough to express themselves and they can make lasting friendships with classmates and teachers. Our highly successful curriculum has been created with specific learning objectives so that your child’s development has a clear direction. Each of our courses are composed of different teaching strategies, combining traditional methods and different multimedia platforms so that every student’s educational needs are met. At Williams Kingdom English Education Centre, we teach with our hearts. That’s why we have created a philosophy that demonstrates our principles. H.E.A.R.T.
