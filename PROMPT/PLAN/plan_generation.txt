PAGE GENERATION 
follow instruction in this file exactly and carefully.
DO NOT SUMMARIZE OUR CHAT HISTORY

Never be verbose towards me. Only mark your progress using the given status messages:  
====================================================
A. INITIAL SETUP
====================================================

1. Read PLAN/MAIN.txt  
   - Extract the list of routes in the exact order they appear.

2. Prepare to process **one route at a time**.  
   - After finishing one route, **stop and wait** for the user to say “continue”.

3. Todo list genration

3a. Start route processing  
   → Status example: "starting route /about"

3b. Check if PLAN/PAGES/[route].txt already exists and has content  
   → Status example: "checking for existing file"  
   → If exists, skip to 3g

3d. Load associated HTML from archive path  
   → Status example: "loading html source"

3e. Begin section‑by‑section extraction   
   → Statuses:  
     • "starting section 1"  
     • "extracting text"  
     • "asset found, performing assets_handling.txt"  
     • "rewriting internal link to MAIN.txt route"  
     • "checking section for missed content"
     • Status example: "updating mp4.txt"

3f. Build and Save file to PLAN/PAGES/[route].txt  
   → Status example: "saving output file"

3g. Stop and wait for user command  
   → Status example: "route complete, awaiting continue to next route [route]"

====================================================
B. FOR EACH ROUTE (IN ORDER)
====================================================

1. Identify the current route.  
   - If the route is `/`, the output filename must be `root.txt`.  
   - Otherwise, output filename is `PLAN/PAGES/[route].txt`.

2. Check if the output file already exists AND contains text.  
   - If yes → **skip this route** and wait for user instruction.  
   - If no → proceed.

3. Locate the associated HTML file using the path provided in MAIN.txt.

====================================================
C. EXTRACTING CONTENT FROM THE HTML
====================================================

1. Extract **all raw text content** from the page:  
   - Paragraphs  
   - Captions  
   - Small text  
   - Any visible text  
   - Keep original language  
   - **Do NOT include styling, fonts, localization metadata, or formatting details.**

2. Extract all assets (mp3, mp4, svg, png, jpg, gif, etc.)  
   - **Include every image**, including banners, background images, icons, logos, and decorative images.  
   - **Do NOT extract fonts.**  
   - For each asset, follow the rules in `assets_handling.txt`.  
   - Always include the asset path AND its resolution.  
   - For each asset, add a concise purpose line explaining its role in that section (e.g., "Purpose: hero banner background", "Purpose: course icon", "Purpose: teacher portrait").

3. Extract all links:  
   - If the link points to another page in the site tree →  
     **Replace the URL with the ROUTE listed in MAIN.txt**, not the archive path.  
   - If the link points to an external resource (e.g., YouTube, WhatsApp) →  
     Keep the original URL unchanged.

====================================================
D. BUILDING THE OUTPUT FILE

1. Follow the exact required format.
