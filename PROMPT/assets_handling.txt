ASSET HANDLING WORKFLOW

====================================================
A. INITIAL SETUP
====================================================

1. Identify the asset encountered in the archive SPA tree  
   - Determine its file extension (mp4, png, svg, jpg, etc.)

2. Prepare the corresponding PLAN/ASSETS/[ext].txt file  
   - The file must be named exactly after the extension, e.g.:
     PLAN/ASSETS/mp4.txt  
     PLAN/ASSETS/png.txt  
     PLAN/ASSETS/svg.txt  
   - If the file does not exist, create it.

3. Todo list generation

3a. Start asset processing  
   → Status example: "processing asset archive/path/to/file.png"

3b. Check if the archive file path is already listed in PLAN/ASSETS/[ext].txt  
   → Status example: "checking asset list"  
   → If the archive path already exists, use the existing mapped asset path for Step2.txt  
   → If not, continue to 3c

3c. Add new asset entry  
   - Choose a clean, suitable name for the asset inside /assets/  
   - If the chosen directory does not exist, add mkdir commands at the top of the assets.txt list  
     Example:  
       mkdir -p assets/home  
       mkdir -p assets/home/about
   - Ensure the new filename is cleaner than the archive’s original (avoid messy names like banner_new(1).png)
   - IMPORTANT: The archive file path must be written **exactly**, unchanged.

3d. Write the copy command  
   Example:  
     cp archive/path/to/file.png assets/home/logo.png  
     cp archive/path/of/file.png assets/home/banner.png  
     cp archive/path/to/another/file.svg assets/home/about/header.svg

3e. Ensure no duplicate files are created  
   - If an asset already exists in the list, do not create a new entry.

3f. Save updated PLAN/ASSETS/[ext].txt  
   → Status example: "updating png.txt"

3g. Stop and wait for user command  
   → Status example: "asset entry complete, awaiting continue"

====================================================
B. FOR EACH ASSET (IN ORDER OF ENCOUNTER)
====================================================

1. Identify the asset’s file extension  
   - Determine which PLAN/ASSETS/[ext].txt file to use.

2. Check if the archive path already exists in the list  
   - If yes → use the existing mapped asset path  
   - If no → generate a new entry following the rules above.

3. Ensure directory creation commands (mkdir -p) are included at the top of the file  
   - Only add them if the directory has not been created before.

====================================================
C. RULES FOR ADDING NEW ASSETS
====================================================

1. The archive file path must be written exactly as it appears  
   - No renaming, no trimming, no modifications.

2. The new asset path must be clean and organized  
   - Prefer short, readable filenames.  
   - Organize assets into folders such as:  
     assets/home  
     assets/home/about  
     assets/course/math  
   - Avoid cluttered or auto-generated names.

3. Do NOT create duplicate entries  
   - If an asset already exists, reuse its mapped path.

4. Every new entry must include:  
   - mkdir commands (if needed)  
   - cp command mapping archive → assets  
   - Clean filename in the assets folder

====================================================
D. OUTPUT FORMAT FOR EACH NEW ASSET
====================================================

Example block (must follow this structure exactly):

mkdir -p assets/home
mkdir -p assets/home/about

cp archive/path/to/file.png assets/home/logo.png
cp archive/path/of/file.png assets/home/banner.png
cp archive/path/to/another/file.svg assets/home/about/header.svg

====================================================
E. FINALIZATION
====================================================

1. Save updates to PLAN/ASSETS/[ext].txt  
2. Return to page generation
