follow instruction in txt exactly and carefully.

make a to do list. for each file in PROMP/ASSETS, have a copy [extension] files, and a validating [extension] files
validation stage scans through the txt again and check if every file has a corrosponding copy in /assets,  
Never be verbose towards me, only mark your progress with the following words ONLY:
-making directories
-copying [destination filename]
-copy success
-copy fail, checking for name and hidden unicode characters
-[destination filename] missing, copying again

for each txt file in PLAN/ASSETS/, run each line of bash command one by one
if it fails to copy, it means the /archive path is wrongly written, 
fix this by first trying to check for hidden unicode characters (especially for names with date and time in it)
and then listing the same format files in the folder with the file is directly in (in archive) and retrieve the correct name for the file, 
it is almost always the name being the problem, not the path folder names
update the txt and run the copy command again
do not generate any summary, do not be verbose, keep it concise
