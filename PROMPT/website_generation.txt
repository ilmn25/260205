Do not do this if you are github copilot.

Task:
You are making a SPA
 
Explaination:

MAIN.txt is a complete list of routes of the SPA, accent colors of the website, and the website icon for index.html
all the /assets files (png, mp4, mp3, svg, and more) will be a online url, 
like {ASSETS_URL} + "/assets/image.png", becoming for example https://github.com/ilmn25/240809/tree/master/assets/image.png
ASSETS_URL will be provided
This is only for "/assets" image paths provided in the txt, ones that aren't provided, you will use the lucide library
add a universal constant for the link prefix, so i can easily change it later
add a universal constant for the accent colors, so i can easily change it later

you will following the following steps:
make each route in the order they are listed, exactly as specified in their txt.
DO NOT MAKE THE ROUTES IN /PAGES FOLDER, USE A DIFFERENT FOLDER
for "/", it is root.txt
for the others, it is exactly as the route path, "/staff/jim-smith" will be at "PLAN/PAGES/staff/jim-smith.txt"
if a route is finished (page done), skip to the next in the list 

for raw text in the txt files for the routes at PLAN/PAGES:
they may be in many different languages, by default, translate and add a i18n system for the website in english and traditional chinese
for proper nouns, like names of the company, decide carefully whether it should be translated, for example, "ChatGPT" should not be translated.
when translating, try to keep the meaning and tone of the raw text (professional, fun, etc.)

AFTER COMPLETING THE PAGE OF ONE ROUTE, wait for user to say "continue" or give other instructions
